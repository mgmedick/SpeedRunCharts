        <h4>What is it?</h4>
        <div class="pl-3">
            This site is intended to focus on trends and analysis of the data from <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/">speedrun.com</a>. For example showing the most recent runs in the top 5% of their category, or showing a graph of the top 10 runs for a particular game/category, etc. Additionally the site is designed to have a browsable front end with more analysis features as the user drills in. The idea is to show the data in a way that's different than speedrun.com and interesting for both fans of watching speedruns as well as speedrunners.

        <h4>How frequently is the data updated?</h4>
        <div class="pl-3">
            The speedruns are updated every 15 mins via the speedrun.com API. The Games are updated nightly to keep up with changes to the Categories, Variables, Levels, etc.

        <h4>Any future plans?</h4>
        <div class="pl-3">
            We plan to get a user login in place, then offer additional features for users that have accounts (ability to customize categories on landing page, customize graphs, etc). Then if possible we'd like to get an API token with the folks at speedrun.com so that users can submit speedruns from our site (users would link their speedruncharts.com account with their speedrun.com account). We also plan on making the site more mobile friendly as well as more analysis features).
